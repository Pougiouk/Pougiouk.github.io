# TODO:
- If window width to height ratio are some value (cant think rn) different to the biggest svg change navbar location to be on top (this accounts for large vertical screens and phones with different aspect ratios).
- Change pixel and cm values to % of the screen width depending on how they look locally.
- Maybe side bar could function as my cv/resume.
- Home could be a sandbox type place where is show off my abilities.
- In home I should write at the very top that I learnt as I built the website.
- Recipies is where I have recipies ive made, they are going to be detailed with pictures and both in metric and imperial units.
- Projects will have links to projects that are in progress or finished.
- Lastly add an about me section where I detail that this is my first big project and go into more depth about the difficulties I faced and what I learnt from them.
- Create error route page.
